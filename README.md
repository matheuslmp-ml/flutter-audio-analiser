# Audio Analysis Project
Based on this project I published a article on Medium talk about the challenges end discovery during the development process.

## Features
### Noise measure
Measure the microphone input noise with a decibels scale dB (-60 to 0)
### Pitch detecting
The algorithm is designed to detect pitches within the frequency spectrum of string instruments 32.7 Hz to 2093.0 Hz

## What you can see here
- Native MethodChannel callers
- Native EventChannel listening
- Complex design widgets
- Performance tests with the same algorithm in Kotlin and Dart

## TODOs
- iOS integration
- Kotlin Multiplataform test
